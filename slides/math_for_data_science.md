## Who am I?

* PhD from University of Utah in 2014 working under Mladen
* Worked for [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) doing supply chain optimization and forecasting
* Now at [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com) teaching data science and consulting
* [Slides](https://github.com/brianmanngalvanize/UtahGSACTalk/blob/master/slides/math_for_data_science.pdf)

## What is Data Science?

* Learning patterns or behavior from observed data, generally to predict behavior of new observations
* Uses statistics, computer science, machine learning

### Examples

* Predict when to build new data centers accounting for a noisy demand signal (this is what I did at AWS)
* Given a satellite photo of a whale at the surface of the ocean, determine which particular whale it is (NOAA Right Whale Kaggle competition)
* Determine whether the effect of changing the UI on your company's phone app was significant
* Given a photo of an eye, determine if the individual has diabetic retinopathy

## Intro to Classification Algorithms

* Observed data represented by points in $\mathbb{R}^N$
* Training observations labelled "positive" or "negative" (we'll use $\{ +1, -1\}$)
* Goal: create a model function $g : \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \{+1, -1\}$ that predicts the class of new observations.

## How?

* Use the training data!
* Find a function $g$ that minimizes the error on the training set *without overfitting*
* Think about trying to model a trend on 20 data points with a 20 degree polynomial

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

* Idea: try to separate classes by an optimal hyperplane
* Here *optimal* means that the minimum distance from the hyperplane to any of the training points (the *margin*) is maximal.

## More SVM
* Quadratic optimization problem
* Can be solved via the method of Lagrange Multipliers
* The optimal hyperplane in SVM has the form $$f(x) = \sum_i a_i \langle x_i, x \rangle + b = 0$$ where $\{x_i\}$ are your training observations and $a_i \neq 0$ if and only if $x_i$ is a *support vector* (the points on the edge of the margin)
* Let $g(x) = sgn(f(x))$

## Ok, that sounds great. What's the problem?

## The solution

* Map our data to a higher dimensional space where it's (almost) linearly separable

## Talk's over, right?

* Not quite, there's still some problems

## Issue 1: Memory

* Even for polynomial transformations, the numbers of dimensions (features) in the target space can grow very quickly
* Consider the transformation $\phi: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^5$ given by $$(x_1, x_2) \mapsto (x_1^2, x_1x_2, x_2^2, x_1, x_2, 1)$$
* More generally, a mapping $\phi_d: \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{N+d \choose d}$ that maps a vector to the vector of all monomial terms in $N$ variables of degree $\leq d$
* $N+d \choose d$ grows *very* quickly as $d >> 0$

## Issue 2: Computation

* The optimal hyperplane for the transformed data is $$f(x) = \sum_i a_i \cdot \langle \phi(x_i), \phi(x) \rangle + b = 0$$
* Need to compute the dot product of high-dimensional vectors (in fact, sometimes they might be infinite dimensional!)

## A solution

* What if there was a way to compute $\langle \phi(x), \phi(y) \rangle$ directly without ever computing $\phi(x)$ or $\phi(y)$?
* There is!
* This is what *kernel functions* do for us


## Kernels

* Make $\phi$ implicit
* This implicit $\phi$ might have an infinite dimensional target vector space

## What is a kernel function?

A *kernel function* is a continuous function $$K: \mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ which satisfies

1. $K(x,y) = K(y,x)$ (symmetric)
2. $K$ is positive-semidefinite i.e. $$\sum_i \sum_j K(x_i, x_j)c_ic_j \geq 0$$ for all finite sequences $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ and all $c_i, c_j \in \mathbb{R}$

## Mercer's Theorem

*Mercer's Theorem* says that if $K : \mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a kernel function, then there exists a vector space with an inner product (a *Hilbert space*) $V$ and a mapping $\phi: \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow V$ so that $$K(x,y) = \langle \phi(x), \phi(y) \rangle$$

* In English, if $K$ is a kernel function, it consists of a transformation followed by an inner product in some higher dimensional space $V$.

* Kernels allow us to compute high-dimensional inner products in $V$ in terms of our original inputs in $\mathbb{R}^N$.

## Example: Polynomial kernel

* $K(x,y) = (\langle x, y \rangle + c)^d$
* $c$ and $d$ are chosen *a priori* by the user, not trained
* Comes from the polynomial transformation $\phi_d$

![Polynomial Kernel](../images/svm_kernel_poly.png){ width=200px }

## Example: RBF (Gaussian) kernel

* $K(x,y) = \exp(-\gamma||x - y||^2)$
* $\gamma$ is chosen *a priori* by the user

## More RBF kernel
What are $\phi$ and the dimension of $V$ in this case?

* Let $\gamma = 1/2$ for ease of computation, then $$\displaystyle K(x,y) = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{\langle x,y \rangle^j}{j!} \exp(\frac{-||x||^2}{2}) \exp(\frac{-||y||^2}{2})$$
* With a little algebra one gets $$\displaystyle \phi(x) = \left(\frac{e^{-\frac{||x||^2}{2j}}}{\sqrt{j!}^{1/j}} {j \choose n_1,\ldots,n_k}^{1/2}\right)_{j=0,\ldots, \infty, \sum_{i=1}^k n_i= j} $$
* $V$ is infinite dimensional ($V = l^2$ the space of square-summable sequences)

## Questions?

## Tips for transitioning to industry

* I'll focus on data science, but a lot of this applies elsewhere

## Learn a programming language

* Python
    * Popular, big active community
    * Scikit-Learn is one of the best machine learning libraries available
    * General purpose programming language - not just for math and statistics
* R
    * Popular, but fewer contributors
    * Designed with data and statistics in mind
    * Not so great as a general purpose language, but great for *ad hoc* data analysis

## More programming languages

* Scala
    * Higher barrier to entry than Python/R
    * Compiles to Java bytecode, so it can use any Java package
    * Functional
    * Will be able to use it at company that uses Java
* Java
    * Immensely popular in the software development industry
    * Not so great with data analysis and statistics
    * Standard in CS cirriculum.

## Get connected

* Find colleagues or friends in industry to refer you
    * Much much higher success rate than just submitting your resume online
* Use LinkedIn and Twitter
* Write a technical blog
* Start writing some code and use github

## Speaking of github

* Learn to use version control (git)

## Focus on getting good at just a few things

* Stick to one programming language to start (Python)
* Pick a goal job and focus on the skills needed to get it
    * Data scientist: stats, machine learning, data cleaning, basic programming and CS skills
    * Software developer: Java, Scala, or Python. CS fundamentals (data structures, algorithms)

## Machine Learning

* Andrew Ng Machine Learning course on [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org)
* *Learning from Data*, Abu-Mostafa, Magdon-Ismail, Lin
* *Introduction to Statistical Learning*, James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) competitions

## Try before you buy

* If you think we might want to go into industry, get a summer internship
* Looks great on your resume
* Builds your professional network
